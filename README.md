Java Library Management System
A Java-based Library Management System demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, file handling, and CRUD operations for managing books and users efficiently.
 
Project Overview
This project is a Library Management System built in Java. It allows users to manage a library’s inventory and user records through a simple, interactive interface. It emphasizes core Java concepts, including classes, objects, methods, and file handling, making it a strong beginner-to-intermediate Java project for showcasing programming skills.
 
Features
•	Add, update, delete, and view books
•	Manage library users
•	Track book availability and status
•	Search books by title, author, or ID
•	Console-based user interface for simplicity and clarity
 
Technologies Used
•	Java – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
•	File Handling – Storing and retrieving book/user data
•	Console Interface – Simple and easy-to-use interactive system
 
How to Run
1.	Clone the repository:
2.	git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Java-Library-Management-System.git
